I will write the second paragraph instead

There once was a boy on an urban train. The train was empty, because of 
hysteria due to the coronavirus!

However, this is an "URBAN" train. The technology is all high-end from every
corners of the world. The boy only said "Hey, Sili!", then, the train answer
"What can I help for you?"

The boy then said "Show me countries that are suffering from coronavirus". The
train instantly showed a hologram of the world map with many countries marked 
with red color. The boy said "Let's go to these countries and use our high-end
equipment to help people!" The urban train speeded up to its next location - 
New York.

Then the boy changed train carts and moved to a much more relaxing train car. He wanted to get away from thinking about corona virus. Then he took a nap.
